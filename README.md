Dual Modulation Drone Generator is a polifonic drone generator which allows you to create synthetic textures directly on your browser. 

It exploits both an AM (amplitude modulation) of sinusoidal waves by means of random triangular LFOs, and a double and reciprocal FM (frequency modulation) between pairs of oscillators. Click on the window to create a sinusoidal wave (symbolized by a circle). 

The x-axis represents the frequencies, from 5Hz to 2000Hz. The y-axis represents the maximum amplitude reached by the LFO. Each sinusoid is amplitude modulated by a random triangular LFO, with a frequency from a minimum of 0.001Hz to a maximum of 0.2Hz. 

Press 'L' and then Click+Drag from an existing circle to an other one, to link two sinusoids and create a mutual double frequency modulation (symbolized by a line), where each sinusoid is treated as a carrier frequency modulated by a modulation Pulse (with random Pulse Width) at the same frequency of the other sinusoid of the pair. 

Click on an existing circle to delete it or to delete the modulation pair of which it is part. And Enjoy.
